TUPLE : ()
Ordered             -> Elements are stored in a specific sequence, and indexing follow the order.
Immutable           -> Tuples cannot be modified after cration(no adding, removing or changing value).
Heterogenous        -> A Tuples can store different data types(integers,string,floats,etc.).
Indexted            -> Elements can be accedde using zero-based indexing and negative indexing.
Allows Duplicates   -> Tuples can contain duplicaate values.
Fixed Size          -> Once created, the tuple's size remains constant (because of immutable )

DICTIONARY : {key : value}
Ordered                        -> Elements are stored in a specific sequence.
key-value pairs                -> Store data as {key:value}pairs.
Key Must be Unique & Immutable -> keys must be unique and  immutable types(e.g, string number or tuples with immutalbe elements) it means we use tuple also as key.
Values can we any type         -> values can be of any data type including lists and othere dictionary, etc
Mutable                        -> Dictionary can be modified (Elemtns can be added, removed, or changed).
Heterogenous                   -> A Dictionary can store different data types(integers,string,floats,etc.).
Elements Access by keys        -> Elements only access using keys.
Does not allow Duplicate Keys  -> Lists can not contain duplicate values.
